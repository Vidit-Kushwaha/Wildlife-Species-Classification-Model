# Wildlife Species Classification
## Overview
This project aims to classify images of various wildlife species using a deep learning model. The model leverages TensorFlow and Keras to build and train a custom image classifier based on the MobileNetV2 architecture.

## Features
- Data Augmentation: Applied to improve model generalization.
- Pre-trained Model: Uses MobileNetV2 as a feature extractor.
- Training & Validation: Includes scripts for training and evaluating the model.
- Model Saving & Loading: Save and reload the model for future use.
- TensorFlow.js Conversion: Convert the model to TensorFlow.js for use in web applications.

## Installation
1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Vidit-Kushwaha/Wildlife-Species-Classification-Model.git
cd wildlife-species-classification
```
2. Google Colab Setup:

If using Google Colab, mount your Google Drive and install TensorFlow Hub:

```python
from google.colab import drive
drive.mount('/content/drive')

!pip install tensorflow_hub
```

## Usage
1. Prepare Your Data:

Place your images in a directory structure like this:

```kotlin
Copy code
data/
  train/
    class1/
      img1.jpg
      img2.jpg
    class2/
      img1.jpg
      img2.jpg
  val/
    class1/
      img1.jpg
      img2.jpg
    class2/
      img1.jpg
      img2.jpg
```

2. Run Training:

  Open the Jupyter notebook or Python script and execute the cells to train the model. The script includes data augmentation, model training, and evaluation.

3. Evaluate and Save the Model:

  After training, the modelâ€™s performance will be evaluated, and the model will be saved as wildlife_classifier.h5.

4. Convert to TensorFlow.js:

  To use the model in a web application, convert it using TensorFlow.js:
  
  ```bash
  Copy code
  pip install tensorflowjs
  tensorflowjs_converter --input_format=tf_saved_model --output_format=tfjs_graph_model --weight_shard_size_bytes=4194304 path/to/saved_model tfjsmodel/
  ```

5. Example
  To run inference on a new image, use the provided code snippets or functions in the Jupyter notebook.
